    "First Data for Passive Data Collection using Smartwatches and GPS from the PREACT Study. \n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Treatment personalization is highly discussed to counteract insufficient response rates in psychotherapy. In the quest for criteria allowing informed selection or adaptation, ambulatory assessment data are a key component, as processes happening outside of therapy sessions can be depicted in high temporal and/or spatial resolution.\n",
    "Here, we introduce PREACT, a multicenter prospective-longitudinal study investigating different predictors of non-response (i.e. EEG, fMRI) in around 500 patients undergoing cognitive behavioral therapy for internalizing disorders.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "Patients can enroll for therapy-accompanying ambulatory assessment. They are provided with a customized study app and a state-of-the-art smartwatch collecting passive data like GPS and heart rate for up to 365 days. In parallel, three 14-day EMA phases (pre-, mid- and post-therapy) cover transdiagnostic (i.e. emotion regulation), contextual and therapy-related aspects.  \n",
